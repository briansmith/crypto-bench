* fastpbkdf2 is also benchmarked, for PBKDF2 only.
* "Suite B" refers the the P-256 and P-384 elliptic curves.
* "SHA-2" refers to SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.


## How to contribute

### Add new benchmarks

Follow the style of the existing examples. When implementing the same benchmark
across multiple implementations, make sure that you're comparing the same
thing (as much as is practical). Also, follow the submodule structure and
naming scheme used in the existing benchmarks. It is often useful to create
macros to minimize the amount of boilerplate required.

### Add tools for visualizing the results

For example, it would be great to be able to get a graph or a table, or JSON
that can be imported into some charting library, that allows one to compare the
performance of one implementation to another. Similarly, it would be awesome to
have a tool that allows one to see how the performance of a particular crypto
library changes between versions.

These tools do *not* need to be written in Rust. They can be in Python or
shell scripts or whatever. I highly recommend just scraping the output of
`cargo bench` (and/or `./cargo_all bench`) instead of trying to make changes to
rustc, Cargo, and the Rust standard library. Perfect is the enemy of the good.



## How to run all the benchmarks for all implementations

These benchmarks currently only can be built/run using Nightly Rust because
they use Rust's built-in benchmarking feature, and that feature is marked
"unstable" (i.e. "Nightly-only").

On non-Windows systems:
```
git clone https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench && \
cd crypto-bench && \
./cargo_all bench
```

On Windows:
```
git clone https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench && cd crypto-bench && cargo_all bench
```

You must use Rust Nightly because `cargo bench` is used for these benchmarks,
and only Right Nightly supports `cargo bench`.

You don't need to run `cargo build`, and in fact `cargo build` does not do
anything useful for this crate.

`./cargo_all test` (`cargo_all test` on Windows) runs one iteration of every
benchmark for every implementation. This is useful for quickly making sure that
a change to the benchmarks does not break them. Do this before submitting a
pull request.



## How to run all the benchmarks for a specific crypto library

* `(cd fastpbkdf2 && cargo bench)` runs all the tests for [rust-fastpbkdf2](https://github.com/ctz/rust-fastpbkdf2).
* `(cd octavo && cargo bench)` runs all the tests for [Octavo](https://github.com/libOctavo/octavo).
* `(cd openssl && cargo bench)` runs all the tests for [rust-openssl](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl).
* `(cd ring && cargo bench)` runs all the tests for [*ring*](https://github.com/briansmith/ring).
* `(cd rust_crypto && cargo bench)` runs all the tests for [rust-crypto](https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto).
* `(cd sodiumoxide && cargo bench)` runs all the tests for [sodiumoxide](https://github.com/dnaq/sodiumoxide).



## How to run other subsets of the benchmarks

`cargo bench` takes arbitrary substrings of the test names as parameters, so
you can get as specific as you want. For example,
`./cargo_all bench sha512::_2000` (`cargo_all bench sha512::_2000 on Windows`)
will run just the SHA-512 benchmark that takes a 2000 byte input, for every
implementation.



## Why does each implementation's benchmark live in a separate crate?

* Not all implementations build and work on all platforms. And, some
  implementations requre manual configuration (e.g. building/installing some
  third-party C library) to work. The `cargo_all` scripts keep going on
  failure, so they'll build/test/benchmark whatever implementations actually
  work, and skip over the ones that don't. This would be difficult to acheive
  if all the benchmarks were in one crate.

* Some implementations (*ring* and any of the crates that use OpenSSL) cannot
  (correctly) coexist in the same program because they define extern C symbols
  with the same names, but which have different ABIs.
